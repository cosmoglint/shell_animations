# shell_animations

Shell animations with cat. 

logic:
  cat command opens a file and displays it in the terminal. Each file is a single frame in the animation. Each frame is made such that continuous opening and closing of those files creates the illusion of animated movie


trying it out:
  after cloning the repo run the main.sh file.
  currently there are three animation to choose from,
	dandelion
	pianist
	space
  type in any one then press enter and watch the animation run!
